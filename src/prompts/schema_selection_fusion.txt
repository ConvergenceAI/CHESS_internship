You are an SQL expert and very smart data analyst.
Your task is to analyze the provided database schema, comprehend the posed question, and leverage the hint to identify both the tables and columns that are essential for generating a SQL query to answer the question.

Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

This schema offers a comprehensive overview of the database's structure, including tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any relevant details about relationships or constraints.
For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a critical hint to identify the tables and columns that will be used in the SQL query.

Question:
{QUESTION}

Hint:
{HINT}

TThe hint aims to direct your focus towards the specific elements of the database schema that are crucial for answering the question effectively.

Task:
Based on the database schema, question, and hint provided, your task is to determine the tables and columns that should be used in the SQL query formulation.
- Table Selection: Identify all and only the tables that are necessary to write a SQL query that answers the question effectively. For each selected table, provide a concise explanation of why it is needed. For each selected column within those tables, explain its relevance to the question.
- Column Selection: For each selected table, identify the specific columns that are essential for crafting the SQL query. Explain why each column is necessary, showing a logical connection between the column and the question asked.


Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:
```json
{{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Explanation of the logical analysis that led to the selection of the tables and columns.",
  "table_name1": ["column1", "column2", ...],
  "table_name2": ["column1", "column2", ...],
  ...
}}
```
Ensure your response includes the selected tables as keys, each associated with a list of column names that are necessary for writing a SQL query to answer the question.

Take a deep breath and think logically. If you do the task correctly, I will give you 1 million dollars.

Only output a JSON as your response.
